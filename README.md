# Execrcise-Correction-Plus-AI-Gym-Tracker
In this project, we will build our very own AI-powered gym tracker using AI Powered Pose estimation. Weâ€™ll leverage MediaPipe and Python to detect different posts from a webcam feed. Then render the results to the screen using OpenCV. As part of it we will also learn how to extract joint coordinates and calculate joint angles!
